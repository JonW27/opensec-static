        openSec assumes that you know little to no information about cybersecurity. We will attempt to guide you along the way, but in such a manner such that you search to find the answer yourself. Structured cybersecurity questions do not do you much good because the field requires that you think out of the box. In this case, think about what had to happen for you to see this webpage. Someone (me) had to code it. Might you be able to see what I wrote?
